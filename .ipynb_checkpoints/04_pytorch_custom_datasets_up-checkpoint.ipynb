    "\n",
    "A **custom dataset** is a collection of data relating to a specific problem you're working on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, a **custom dataset** can be comprised of almost anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we were building a food image classification app like [Nutrify](https://nutrify.app), our custom dataset might be images of food.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or if we were trying to build a model to classify whether or not a text-based review on a website was positive or negative, our custom dataset might be examples of existing customer reviews and their ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or if we were trying to build a sound classification app, our custom dataset might be sound samples alongside their sample labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or if we were trying to build a recommendation system for customers purchasing things on our website, our custom dataset might be examples of products other people have bought.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"resources/04-pytorch-domain-libraries.jpg\" alt=\"different pytorch domain libraries can be used for specific PyTorch problems\" width=1000/>\n",
    "\n",
    "*PyTorch includes many existing functions to load in various custom datasets in the [`TorchVision`](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/index.html), [`TorchText`](https://pytorch.org/text/stable/index.html), [`TorchAudio`](https://pytorch.org/audio/stable/index.html) and [`TorchRec`](https://pytorch.org/torchrec/) domain libraries.*\n",
    "\n",
    "But sometimes these existing functions may not be enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "In that case, we can always subclass `torch.utils.data.Dataset` and customize it to our liking."

    "| **0. Importing PyTorch and setting up device-agnostic code** | Let's get PyTorch loaded and then follow best practice to setup our code to be device-agnostic.  |\n",
    "| **1. Get data** | We're going to be using our own **custom dataset** of pizza, steak and sushi images. |\n",
    "| **2. Become one with the data (data preparation)** | At the beginning of any new machine learning problem, it's paramount to understand the data you're working with. Here we'll take some steps to figure out what data we have. |\n",
    "| **3. Transforming data** |Often, the data you get won't be 100% ready to use with a machine learning model, here we'll look at some steps we can take to *transform* our images so they're ready to be used with a model. | \n",
    "| **4. Loading data with `ImageFolder` (option 1)** | PyTorch has many in-built data loading functions for common types of data. `ImageFolder` is helpful if our images are in standard image classification format. |\n",
    "| **5. Loading image data with a custom `Dataset`** | What if PyTorch didn't have an in-built function to load data with? This is where we can build our own custom subclass of `torch.utils.data.Dataset`. |\n",
    "| **6. Other forms of transforms (data augmentation)** | Data augmentation is a common technique for expanding the diversity of your training data. Here we'll explore some of `torchvision`'s in-built data augmentation functions. |\n",
    "| **7. Model 0: TinyVGG without data augmentation** | By this stage, we'll have our data ready, let's build a model capable of fitting it. We'll also create some training and testing functions for training and evaluating our model. |\n",
    "| **8. Exploring loss curves** | Loss curves are a great way to see how your model is training/improving over time. They're also a good way to see if your model is **underfitting** or **overfitting**. |\n",
    "| **9. Model 1: TinyVGG with data augmentation** | By now, we've tried a model *without*, how about we try one *with* data augmentation? |\n",
    "| **10. Compare model results** | Let's compare our different models' loss curves and see which performed better and discuss some options for improving performance. |\n",
    "| **11. Making a prediction on a custom image** | Our model is trained to on a dataset of pizza, steak and sushi images. In this section we'll cover how to use our trained model to predict on an image *outside* of our existing dataset. |"
