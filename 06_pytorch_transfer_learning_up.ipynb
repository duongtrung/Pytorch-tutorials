    "## What is transfer learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transfer learning** allows us to take the patterns (also called weights) another model has learned from another problem and use them for our own problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we can take the patterns a computer vision model has learned from datasets such as [ImageNet](https://www.image-net.org/) (millions of images of different objects) and use them to power our FoodVision Mini model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or we could take the patterns from a [language model](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#masked-language-model) (a model that's been through large amounts of text to learn a representation of language) and use them as the basis of a model to classify different text samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "The premise remains: find a well-performing existing model and apply it to your own problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"resources/06-transfer-learning-example-overview.png\" alt=\"transfer learning overview on different problems\" width=600/>\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example of transfer learning being applied to computer vision and natural language processing (NLP). In the case of computer vision, a computer vision model might learn patterns on millions of images in ImageNet and then use those patterns to infer on another problem. And for NLP, a language model may learn the structure of language by reading all of Wikipedia (and perhaps more) and then apply that knowledge to a different problem.*"
