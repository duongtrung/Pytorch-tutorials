    "\n",
    "**Transfer learning** allows us to take the patterns (also called weights) another model has learned from another problem and use them for our own problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we can take the patterns a computer vision model has learned from datasets such as [ImageNet](https://www.image-net.org/) (millions of images of different objects) and use them to power our FoodVision Mini model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or we could take the patterns from a [language model](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#masked-language-model) (a model that's been through large amounts of text to learn a representation of language) and use them as the basis of a model to classify different text samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "The premise remains: find a well-performing existing model and apply it to your own problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"resources/06-transfer-learning-example-overview.png\" alt=\"transfer learning overview on different problems\" width=600/>\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example of transfer learning being applied to computer vision and natural language processing (NLP). In the case of computer vision, a computer vision model might learn patterns on millions of images in ImageNet and then use those patterns to infer on another problem. And for NLP, a language model may learn the structure of language by reading all of Wikipedia (and perhaps more) and then apply that knowledge to a different problem.*\n",

    "Let's go through them:\n",
    "* **Trainable column** - You'll see that many of the base layers (the ones in the `features` portion) have their Trainable value as `False`. This is because we set their attribute `requires_grad=False`. Unless we change this, these layers won't be updated during furture training.\n",
    "* **Output shape of `classifier`** - The `classifier` portion of the model now has an Output Shape value of `[32, 3]` instead of `[32, 1000]`. It's Trainable value is also `True`. This means its parameters will be updated during training. In essence, we're using the `features` portion to feed our `classifier` portion a base representation of an image and then our `classifier` layer is going to learn how to base representation aligns with our problem.\n",
    "* **Less trainable parameters** - Previously there was 5,288,548 trainable parameters. But since we froze many of the layers of the model and only left the `classifier` as trainable, there's now only 3,843 trainable parameters (even less than our TinyVGG model). Though there's also 4,007,548 non-trainable parameters, these will create a base representation of our input images to feed into our `classifier` layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** The more trainable parameters a model has, the more compute power/longer it takes to train. Freezing the base layers of our model and leaving it with less trainable parameters means our model should train quite quickly. This is one huge benefit of transfer learning, taking the already learned parameters of a model trained on a problem similar to yours and only tweaking the outputs slightly to suit your problem."
