    "In the last notebook, [notebook 03](03_pytorch_computer_vision_up.ipynb/), we looked at how to build computer vision models on an in-built dataset in PyTorch (FashionMNIST).\n",

    "The steps we took are similar across many different problems in machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Find a dataset, turn the dataset into numbers, build a model (or find an existing model) to find patterns in those numbers that can be used for prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch has many built-in datasets used for a wide number of machine learning benchmarks, however, you'll often want to use your own **custom dataset**."

    "## What is a custom dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **custom dataset** is a collection of data relating to a specific problem you're working on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, a **custom dataset** can be comprised of almost anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we were building a food image classification app like [Nutrify](https://nutrify.app), our custom dataset might be images of food.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or if we were trying to build a model to classify whether or not a text-based review on a website was positive or negative, our custom dataset might be examples of existing customer reviews and their ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or if we were trying to build a sound classification app, our custom dataset might be sound samples alongside their sample labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or if we were trying to build a recommendation system for customers purchasing things on our website, our custom dataset might be examples of products other people have bought.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"resources/04-pytorch-domain-libraries.png\" alt=\"different pytorch domain libraries can be used for specific PyTorch problems\" width=1000/>\n",
    "\n",
    "*PyTorch includes many existing functions to load in various custom datasets in the [`TorchVision`](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/index.html), [`TorchText`](https://pytorch.org/text/stable/index.html), [`TorchAudio`](https://pytorch.org/audio/stable/index.html) and [`TorchRec`](https://pytorch.org/torchrec/) domain libraries.*\n",
    "\n",
    "But sometimes these existing functions may not be enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "In that case, we can always subclass `torch.utils.data.Dataset` and customize it to our liking."
